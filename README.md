# multiCNN_Emotion-Recognition
Python program to implement Facial Emotion recognition using multiple CNN models for better accuracy.

-This repo contains one 'main' python file for face recognition (using open-cv) and emotion identification using multiple (pre-trained) models.
-queue data-structure and numpy based moving average for smooth transition and real-time analysis.
-More models can be added and weights can be adjusted for further improvement.
