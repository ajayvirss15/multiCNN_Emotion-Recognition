# multiCNN_Emotion-Recognition

Python program to implement Facial Emotion Recognition using multiple CNN models for better accuracy.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python program for facial emotion recognition. It utilizes multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to enhance accuracy. The system uses OpenCV for face detection and pre-trained CNN models for emotion identification. It also employs a queue data structure and numpy-based moving average to ensure smooth transitions and real-time analysis.

## Features

- **Face Recognition:** Uses OpenCV for detecting faces in real-time.
- **Emotion Identification:** Utilizes multiple pre-trained CNN models for recognizing emotions.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Implements a queue data structure and moving average with numpy to provide smooth transitions and real-time analysis.
- **Extendable:** Additional models can be integrated, and weights can be adjusted for further improvement.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajayvirss15/multiCNN_Emotion-Recognition.git
   cd multiCNN_Emotion-Recognition
